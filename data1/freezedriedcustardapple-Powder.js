    "Raw Material Selection - Fresh, fully ripe, and high-quality custard apples are carefully chosen. Cleaning & Washing - Fruits are thoroughly washed to remove dirt, impurities, and surface contaminants.Peeling & Deseeding - The outer skin is removed, and seeds are separated to obtain only the edible pulp. Pulp Preparation - The custard apple pulp is homogenized into a smooth, uniform consistency. Pre-Freezing - The pulp is spread onto trays and frozen at very low temperatures to lock in nutrients, color, and flavor. Freeze-Drying (Lyophilization) - The frozen pulp is subjected to a vacuum freeze-drying process, where ice crystals are sublimated directly into vapor, leaving behind dry fruit solids. Milling / Powdering - The dried fruit is gently milled into a fine powder while preserving its natural aroma and taste. Sieving & Quality Check: Powder is sieved to uniform particle size and tested for quality, microbiological safety, and nutritional retention. Packaging - The powder is packed in moisture-proof, airtight packaging (laminated pouches or bulk containers) to ensure long shelf life. Storage & Dispatch  - Stored under cool, dry conditions before being dispatched for commercial or retail use."
