    "Selection of Raw Material: High-quality, ripe guavas are selected for uniform sweetness, aroma, and color. Fruits should be free from defects, pests, and diseases. Washing and Sorting: Guavas are thoroughly washed to remove dirt, dust, and residues. They are then sorted based on size, ripeness, and quality. Peeling and Deseeding (Optional): Depending on the product requirement, guavas may be peeled. Seeds are removed to ensure a smooth, fine powder. Cutting/Slicing: Guavas are sliced into uniform pieces to allow even drying. Smaller pieces ensure faster and more uniform freeze-drying. Pre-Treatment (Optional): Sometimes, guava pieces are treated with natural antioxidants (like ascorbic acid) to prevent color and nutrient loss. Freezing: Sliced guavas are rapidly frozen at very low temperatures (typically -40°C to -50°C). Rapid freezing helps retain the fruit’s cellular structure, flavor, and nutrients. Primary Drying (Sublimation): The frozen guava slices are placed in a vacuum chamber. Under low pressure, ice is converted directly into vapor (sublimation), removing moisture while preserving flavor, color, and nutrients. Secondary Drying (Desorption): Remaining bound water is removed under slightly higher temperatures in vacuum conditions. Ensures final moisture content is very low (usually 2"
