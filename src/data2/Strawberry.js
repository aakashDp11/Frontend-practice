The process removes moisture while preserving the fruit’s taste, aroma, and antioxidants, resulting in light, crunchy, and shelf-stable chips. 100% natural and free from added sugar, preservatives, or artificial colors, they are perfect as a healthy snack and can also be used in breakfast cereals, trail mixes, desserts, bakery items, and confectionery.",
