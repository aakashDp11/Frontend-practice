      "description": "Freeze Dried Cluster Beans Pieces\n\nFreeze-Dried Cluster Beans (Guvar) Pieces are made from fresh, tender cluster beans that are carefully cut and freeze-dried to preserve their natural green color, mild earthy flavor, crisp texture, and nutritional value, including vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. The process removes moisture while maintaining aroma and nutrients, resulting in light, shelf-stable pieces. 100% natural and free from additives, preservatives, or artificial colors, they are ideal for use in soups, curries, stir-fries, ready-to-eat meals, snack formulations, and health foods.",
