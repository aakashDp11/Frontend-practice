      "description": "Idli-Dosa Batter\n\nFreeze-Dried Idli/Dosa Batter is made from freshly prepared fermented rice and lentil batter that is carefully freeze-dried to preserve its natural flavor, aroma, and nutritional content. The process removes moisture while maintaining the batter’s fermentative qualities and essential nutrients, resulting in a light, shelf-stable product that can be rehydrated easily to make soft idlis or crispy dosas. 100% natural and free from preservatives, additives, or artificial colors, it is ideal for convenient, ready-to-cook breakfast solutions.",

        "Rehydration (For Idli)": "Idlis: Add warm water to make steamer ready batter, Add salt if not already added. Rehydration (For Dosa). Dosa: Add water and whisk well - dosa batter should be pourable and slightly thinner than idli batter (like pancake batter), Add salt if not already added.",
        "Preparation (For Idli)": "Prepare Steamer: Add water in your idli steamer / pressure cooker / electric idli maker. Heat until it starts steaming lightly. Grease Idli Molds: Grease the idli plates with a few drops of oil or ghee (optional, but prevents sticking). Pour Batter: Stir the fermented batter gently, Pour into each mold until about ¾ full (idlis need space to rise). Steam: Place the idli stand in the steamer, Steam on medium heat for 10–12 minutes, Do not open in between, or idlis may collapse. Check for Doneness: Insert a toothpick/knife into one idli — it should come out clean, If sticky, steam for 2–3 minutes more. Cool Slightly & Unmold: Let them rest for 2 minutes after steaming, Use a wet spoon/knife to gently scoop out the idlis.",
        "Preparation": "(For Dosa): Heat the Pan: Use a cast iron tawa (traditional) or a non-stick dosa pan, Heat it until medium-hot. To check: sprinkle a few drops of water - they should sizzle and evaporate quickly. Season the Tawa (if using iron pan), Drizzle a few drops of oil and rub with half an onion/potato or a cloth - this prevents sticking. Spread the Batter: Pour a ladleful of batter in the center, Spread it outwards in a circular motion into a thin round dosa. Cook: Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee along the edges, Cook on medium heat until the edges start lifting and the bottom turns golden brown. For soft dosa: cook covered for 1–2 minutes. For crisp dosa: cook uncovered and let it brown more.",
