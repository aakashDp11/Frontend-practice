The process removes moisture while retaining essential oils, nutrients, and antioxidant properties, resulting in lightweight, shelf-stable leaves with excellent rehydration. 100% natural and free from additives or preservatives, they are ideal for use in curries, spice blends, chutneys, ready-to-eat meals, seasoning mixes, and functional foods.",
