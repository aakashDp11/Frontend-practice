      "description": "Sweet Basil Leaves\n\nFreeze Dried Sweet Basil is made from fresh, aromatic basil leaves that are carefully freeze-dried to preserve their natural bright green color, sweet herbaceous flavor, and essential oils. The process removes moisture while maintaining the leaf’s aroma, taste, and nutritional value, resulting in lightweight, shelf-stable basil with excellent rehydration properties. 100% natural and free from additives or preservatives, it is ideal for use in pasta sauces, soups, salads, pesto mixes, seasoning blends, ready-to-eat meals, and gourmet culinary applications.",
