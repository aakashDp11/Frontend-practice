      "description": "Fenugreek Leaves\n\nFreeze-Dried Fenugreek Leaves are made from fresh, tender fenugreek (methi) leaves that are carefully freeze-dried to preserve their natural green color, distinct aroma, and nutritional value, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The process removes moisture while maintaining taste, aroma, and essential nutrients, resulting in light, shelf-stable leaves. 100% natural and free from additives, preservatives, or artificial colors, they are ideal for use in soups, sauces, spice blends, ready-to-eat meals, bakery products, and health foods.",
