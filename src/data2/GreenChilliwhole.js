      "description": "Green Chilli-Whole\n\nFreeze Dried Green Chilli is made from fresh, spicy green chillies that are carefully freeze-dried to preserve their natural bright green color, sharp heat, fresh aroma, and nutritional value, including vitamins, antioxidants, and capsaicin. The process removes moisture while retaining flavor intensity and essential nutrients, resulting in light, shelf-stable whole or cut pieces with excellent rehydration properties. 100% natural and free from additives or preservatives, they are ideal for use in curries, sauces, chutneys, seasoning mixes, ready-to-eat meals, and snack formulations.",
