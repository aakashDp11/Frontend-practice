The process removes moisture while maintaining its fragrance, taste, and nutritional value, resulting in lightweight, shelf-stable pieces or flakes with excellent rehydration properties. 100% natural and free from additives or preservatives, it is ideal for use in teas, soups, curries, herbal blends, marinades, and functional food formulations.",
