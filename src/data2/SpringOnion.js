      "description": "Freeze Dried Spring Onion Flakes\n\nFreeze-Dried Spring Onion Flakes are made from fresh, high-quality spring onions (green onions) that are carefully sliced and freeze-dried to preserve their natural green-white color, mild onion flavor, and nutritional value, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The process removes moisture while maintaining taste, aroma, and essential nutrients, resulting in light, shelf-stable flakes. 100% natural and free from additives, preservatives, or artificial colors, they are ideal for use in soups, salads, sauces, stir-fries, ready-to-eat meals, and seasoning mixes.",
